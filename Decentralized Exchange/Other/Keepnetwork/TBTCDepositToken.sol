/// @title tBTC Deposit Token for tracking deposit ownership
/// @notice The tBTC Deposit Token, commonly referenced as the TDT, is an
///         ERC721 non-fungible token whose ownership reflects the ownership
///         of its corresponding deposit. Each deposit has one TDT, and vice
///         versa. Owning a TDT is equivalent to owning its corresponding
///         deposit. TDTs can be transferred freely. tBTC's VendingMachine
///         contract takes ownership of TDTs and in exchange returns fungible
///         TBTC tokens whose value is backed 1-to-1 by the corresponding
///         deposit's BTC.
/// @dev Currently, TDTs are minted using the uint256 casting of the
///      corresponding deposit contract's address. That is, the TDT's id is
///      convertible to the deposit's address and vice versa. TDTs are minted
///      automatically by the factory during each deposit's initialization. See
///      DepositFactory.createNewDeposit() for more info on how the TDT is minted.
